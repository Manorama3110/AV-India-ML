India ML Hiring Hackathon 2019

This is the first time I did the submission for a hackathon.

Approach
Most of the time is spent on data analysis part. I droped few columns from the dataset which I felt are of no use like loan_id", "source", "financial_institution", "origination_date", "first_payment_date","loan_purpose‚Äù.  I tried various models like random forest and tried to tune the model with random search. Since the target variable was highly unbalanced, I tried SMOTE to balance the target variable distribution. After random forest with tuned parameters scored the 0.2690058480 in LB. 

How to run the code?
Order of files to run
